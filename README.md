# Implementation-of-generalized-Neural-Network
In this project I am implementing a Generalized Neural Network. Here the number of features, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, number of output unit can be passed as parameter. I am doing this project as a requirement of Pattern Recognition Sessional course of my undergrad.
